          'Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread to all regions of WHO in recent years. Dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes mainly of the species Aedes aegypti and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. These mosquitoes are also vectors of chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika viruses. Dengue is widespread throughout the tropics, with local variations in risk influenced by climate parameters as well as social and environmental factors.\n'
          'Dengue causes a wide spectrum of disease. This can range from subclinical disease (people may not know they are even infected) to severe flu-like symptoms in those infected. Although less common, some people develop severe dengue, which can be any number of complications associated with severe bleeding, organ impairment and/or plasma leakage. Severe dengue has a higher risk of death when not managed appropriately. Severe dengue was first recognized in the 1950s during dengue epidemics in the Philippines and Thailand. Today, severe dengue affects most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children and adults in these regions.\n'
          'Dengue is caused by a virus of the Flaviviridae family and there are four distinct, but closely related, serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4). Recovery from infection is believed to provide lifelong immunity against that serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial, and temporary. Subsequent infections (secondary infection) by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe dengue.\n'
          'Dengue has distinct epidemiological patterns, associated with the four serotypes of the virus. These can co-circulate within a region, and indeed many countries are hyper-endemic for all four serotypes. Dengue has an alarming impact on both human health and the global and national economies. DENV is frequently transported from one place to another by infected travellers; when susceptible vectors are present in these new areas, there is the potential for local transmission to be established.\n',

          'Since there is no proper treatment for dengue, best option is to adopt precautionary measure such as control of mosquitoes which normally flourishes in dirty areas and stagnant water ponds.'
          'The Local Government Department, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has already started awareness campaigns through Tehsil Municipal Administration by installing banners, distribution of pamphlets, fumigation of houses, shops and building. Most of the public places are cleared by using detergent and inspection of bazar to observe anti-dengue SOPs. So far 16490 awareness campaigns are held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including the Merged Areas. 5700 banners are installed. 13389 staff are properly trained and deployed to ensure effective control of dengue in the province.'
          'The Local Government Department is regularly monitoring dengue situation in close coordination with respective district administration and health departments',
