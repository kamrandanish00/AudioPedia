          'Dengue fever also known as break bone fever is a serious and sometimes fatal infection. Dengue is spread by several species of female mosquitoes. The disease may be characterized from mild symptoms to life-threating condition. The symptoms may range from moderate headache, nausea, vomiting, muscular pain, and high-grade fever to severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bleeding gums, low pulse, and narrow pulse pressure. Neurological symptoms may include confusion, unconsciousness, and shock. Early detection and timely initiation of appropriate treatment can reduce mortality to <1% compared with 2â€“5% if left untreated. Recovery generally takes two to seven days.'
