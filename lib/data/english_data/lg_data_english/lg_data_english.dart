      description:
          'The Merged Areas formerly known as Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are the tribal districts bordering with Afghanistan to the north and west marked by Durand Line in the east with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to the south. These districts are Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, North Waziristan and South Waziristan. The six Subdivisions are Hassan Khel, Dara Adam Khel, Wazir, Bettani, Drazanda, and Jandola. These Subdivisions were previously the frontier regions of district Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, D.I. Khan and Tank respectively. The total Merged Area is 27220 Sq.km with an estimated population of 4.9930 million as per Census Report 2017. Post Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-FATA merger scenario was marked by several reasons which required the government to help restore citizen state trust and bridge the wide gaps of socioeconomic development lag.

      title: 'Rationale for Merger',
      description:
          'The process of reforms in the erstwhile FATA was started way back in the early 1970s, however it took more time in term of affecting actual reforms due to special provision of article 246 and 247 in Constitution of Pakistan detailing separate mechanism for governing the areas and extension of laws to tribal districts as and when needed. Traditional Jirga and Political administration had all power for taking decision both in criminal cases and civil cases based on Rewaj (traditions) of concerned communities. People were denied basic right of appeal against the decision of Jirga and political administration. Collective responsibility article in the Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR), punishing whole tribe for the offence of an individual was another bane. Most of other human rights available to the residents of Pakistan were not allowed to tribal people. Interestingly, tribal members of the National Assembly and Senators could legislate for the whole of Pakistan but not for their own areas. Formal judicial system was not available to tribal people having no access to High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan.',

      title: 'Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR)',
      description:
          'The FCR was a special set of laws enacted in 1901 by the British Government for governing the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The FCR remained in effect in Pakistan until 2018. The FCR premise was collective responsibility in case an individual of a family or tribe members commits a crime. The FCR could take cognizance of the whole family or tribe which was a black law as the role of judge and policing vested in one-person - the ‘Political Agent’ of the agency. Tribal Jirga’s being a handpicked people of political administration were the main forum for dispute resolution without any formal right to the accused to trial by judiciary.'
          'Most of the FCR provision were very discriminatory, un-Islamic and against fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan as well as against the Charter of the United Nations Human Rights. For example, the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan clearly stated under article 1 that the residents of erstwhile Fata were Pakistanis like other citizens and had got legal rights to be treated at par with other citizens. However, fundamental human rights enshrined in Articles 4, 8, 9 and 25 of the Constitution were denied to the residents of erstwhile of FATA who were the equal citizens of the country.',

      title: 'Need for abolition of FCR? ',
      description:
          'The FCR was enacted to suppress the tribal people and to ensure their safe passage to Afghanistan border for containing Russian imperial design in the 19th century.  The basic purpose of the FCR was to indirectly administer this region in the interest of the colonial power. Unfortunately, more than half a century after independence of Pakistan, FATA was still ruled through an outdated administrative and legal system till 2018. Denials of basic human, judicial and legal rights coupled with economic deprivation were the main reasons to abolish FCR as per the desire of the residents.',

      title: 'Drawbacks of FCR',
      description:
          'From human rights point of view FCR was a black law as it was differentiating between erstwhile FATA residents and rest of the citizen of Pakistan. The provision of FCR was in clear violation of declaration of universal human rights and the constitution of Pakistan such as freedom of expression, association, and development. FCR was especially silent about crime against women and there was no representation of women in the FCR judicial system.  People had no right to appeal in the High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan, thus leaving them at the mercy of Qusai judicial system of FCR and languishing in jail.'
          'These discrepancies developed lack of trust between the citizen and the state, resulting in chaotic situation in the shape of militancy, challenging the writ of the state. People at large wanted extension of all laws and rights as per the Constitution of Pakistan for the people of tribal districts.'
          'In addition to legal and constitutional lacunas faced by the tribal people, their economic deprivation and low social-economic indicators were the main reason which set the stage for formal merger of erstwhile FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.',

      title: 'Process of Merger',
      description:
          'As per the Constitution of Pakistan, it was mandatory to get the opinion of tribal people whether they want a formal merger of the tribal agencies with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), or some other dispensation as deem appropriate. Accordingly, after controlling the militancy, it was decided to have detailed consultation with all tribal people as per constitutional requirement for seeking their opinion on merger or its independence status like other provinces or status quo for bridging the trust deficit between citizen and state.'
          'For this purpose, ‘Prime Minister Reforms Committee’ headed by veteran political leader Mr. Sartaj Aziz was notified which undertook visits to all tribal areas for consultation. As a result of the consultative process with local tribal, it was recommended that constitution amendment will be made for the merger of former FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as per the wish of tribal people.'
          'Based on the above recommendations, the National Assembly of Pakistan on Thursday, 24 May 2018, passed a historical constitutional amendment seeking the much-awaited merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) with a 229-1 vote in favor.'
          'This negates the effect of FCR in former FATA, rendering it liable to laws and regulations passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and operating under the constitution of Pakistan with immediate effect.',

      title: 'New system after the Merger',
      description:
          'The change in the administrative system was made in pursuance of the Constitution (25th Amendment) Act, 2018 and all other enabling provisions in any other law, for the time being in force, in the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The merger started with a re-designation of political agents, additional political agents and assistant political agents as deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, and assistant commissioners, respectively, who have been empowered as district collectors, sub-divisional and tehsil collectors.'
          'Previously FATA had no official land records except in certain parts of Kurram and North Waziristan districts. Land was distributed as per the tribal system whereby land was allocated to entire tribes instead of individuals. The process of land settlement has since been started on pilot basis after the merger.'
          'The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Court Peshawar had since been extended to Merged Areas with formal establishment of judicial structure entailing posting of District and Session judges and Civil Courts and Session Courts for the dispensation of criminal and civil cases as per normal laws of government of Pakistan in the merged areas.'
          'After the merger there is now no difference between legal, administrative, and political system in vogue in the Merged Areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the rest of Pakistan now.',
