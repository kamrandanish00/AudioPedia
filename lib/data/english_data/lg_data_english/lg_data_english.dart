          'The Merged Areas formerly known as Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are the tribal districts bordering with Afghanistan to the north and west marked by Durand Line in the east with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to the south. These districts are Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, North Waziristan and South Waziristan. The six Subdivisions are Hassan Khel, Dara Adam Khel, Wazir, Bettani, Drazanda, and Jandola. These Subdivisions were previously the frontier regions of district Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, D.I. Khan and Tank respectively. The total Merged Area is 27220 Sq.km with an estimated population of 4.9930 million as per Census Report 2017. Post Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-FATA merger scenario was marked by several reasons which required the government to help restore citizen state trust and bridge the wide gaps of socioeconomic development lag.

      description:
          'The process of reforms in the erstwhile FATA was started way back in the early 1970s, however it took more time in term of affecting actual reforms due to special provision of article 246 and 247 in Constitution of Pakistan detailing separate mechanism for governing the areas and extension of laws to tribal districts as and when needed. Traditional Jirga and Political administration had all power for taking decision both in criminal cases and civil cases based on Rewaj (traditions) of concerned communities. People were denied basic right of appeal against the decision of Jirga and political administration. Collective responsibility article in the Frontier Crimes Regulations (FCR), punishing whole tribe for the offence of an individual was another bane. Most of other human rights available to the residents of Pakistan were not allowed to tribal people. Interestingly, tribal members of the National Assembly and Senators could legislate for the whole of Pakistan but not for their own areas. Formal judicial system was not available to tribal people having no access to High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan.',

      description:
          'The FCR was a special set of laws enacted in 1901 by the British Government for governing the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The FCR remained in effect in Pakistan until 2018. The FCR premise was collective responsibility in case an individual of a family or tribe members commits a crime. The FCR could take cognizance of the whole family or tribe which was a black law as the role of judge and policing vested in one-person - the ‘Political Agent’ of the agency. Tribal Jirga’s being a handpicked people of political administration were the main forum for dispute resolution without any formal right to the accused to trial by judiciary.'
          'Most of the FCR provision were very discriminatory, un-Islamic and against fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan as well as against the Charter of the United Nations Human Rights. For example, the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan clearly stated under article 1 that the residents of erstwhile Fata were Pakistanis like other citizens and had got legal rights to be treated at par with other citizens. However, fundamental human rights enshrined in Articles 4, 8, 9 and 25 of the Constitution were denied to the residents of erstwhile of FATA who were the equal citizens of the country.',

          'The FCR was enacted to suppress the tribal people and to ensure their safe passage to Afghanistan border for containing Russian imperial design in the 19th century.  The basic purpose of the FCR was to indirectly administer this region in the interest of the colonial power. Unfortunately, more than half a century after independence of Pakistan, FATA was still ruled through an outdated administrative and legal system till 2018. Denials of basic human, judicial and legal rights coupled with economic deprivation were the main reasons to abolish FCR as per the desire of the residents.',

      description:
          'From human rights point of view FCR was a black law as it was differentiating between erstwhile FATA residents and rest of the citizen of Pakistan. The provision of FCR was in clear violation of declaration of universal human rights and the constitution of Pakistan such as freedom of expression, association, and development. FCR was especially silent about crime against women and there was no representation of women in the FCR judicial system.  People had no right to appeal in the High Court or Supreme Court of Pakistan, thus leaving them at the mercy of Qusai judicial system of FCR and languishing in jail.'
          'These discrepancies developed lack of trust between the citizen and the state, resulting in chaotic situation in the shape of militancy, challenging the writ of the state. People at large wanted extension of all laws and rights as per the Constitution of Pakistan for the people of tribal districts.'
          'In addition to legal and constitutional lacunas faced by the tribal people, their economic deprivation and low social-economic indicators were the main reason which set the stage for formal merger of erstwhile FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.',

          'As per the Constitution of Pakistan, it was mandatory to get the opinion of tribal people whether they want a formal merger of the tribal agencies with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), or some other dispensation as deem appropriate. Accordingly, after controlling the militancy, it was decided to have detailed consultation with all tribal people as per constitutional requirement for seeking their opinion on merger or its independence status like other provinces or status quo for bridging the trust deficit between citizen and state.'
          'For this purpose, ‘Prime Minister Reforms Committee’ headed by veteran political leader Mr. Sartaj Aziz was notified which undertook visits to all tribal areas for consultation. As a result of the consultative process with local tribal, it was recommended that constitution amendment will be made for the merger of former FATA into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as per the wish of tribal people.'
          'Based on the above recommendations, the National Assembly of Pakistan on Thursday, 24 May 2018, passed a historical constitutional amendment seeking the much-awaited merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) with a 229-1 vote in favor.'
          'This negates the effect of FCR in former FATA, rendering it liable to laws and regulations passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and operating under the constitution of Pakistan with immediate effect.',

The merger started with a re-designation of political agents, additional political agents and assistant political agents as deputy commissioners, additional deputy commissioners, and assistant commissioners, respectively, who have been empowered as district collectors, sub-divisional and tehsil collectors.'
          'Previously FATA had no official land records except in certain parts of Kurram and North Waziristan districts. Land was distributed as per the tribal system whereby land was allocated to entire tribes instead of individuals. The process of land settlement has since been started on pilot basis after the merger.'
          'The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Court Peshawar had since been extended to Merged Areas with formal establishment of judicial structure entailing posting of District and Session judges and Civil Courts and Session Courts for the dispensation of criminal and civil cases as per normal laws of government of Pakistan in the merged areas.'

A perusal of the available statistics of erstwhile FATA indicates that most of the socioeconomic indicators were lagging compared to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For example, 60% of the people were living below the line of poverty. Literacy ratio was 49 % for male and 14 % for female. Similarly, other indicators of clean drinking water, infant mortality rate, mother morbidity rate were far below than average ratio of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  and Pakistan. \n'
          'All these things coupled with lack of institutional framework and essential infrastructure it was felt necessary that some urgent steps are taken for filling this yawning gap of socioeconomic and institutional development in a befitting manner. Accordingly, a ten-year development strategy was designed known as Tribal Decades Strategy (2020-2030) with clear commitment of federal government for providing yearly special grant of at least Rs. 100 billion every year for the next ten year.  The Tribal Decade Strategy (TDS) 2020-2030 aims at redressing the imbalance to bring the tribal people at par with the rest of the country. The provincial cabinet in its meeting held on 9th May 2019, approved the Tribal Decade Strategy. Finalization of the TDS has tapped the beneficiary perspective through deeper consultations to align all planned development with resident needs and priorities. TDS is supported through five pillar of the Development Pentad that forms the basic organizational principles of the developmental approach. The pentad is as follows:\n'
          '1. Building responsive and accountable institutions\n'
          '2. Enhancing human potential\n'
          '3. Expanding economic infrastructure\n'

          'Under the Tribal Decade Strategy, a three-year program was prioritized in the form of Accelerated Implementation Program (AIP), comprising of 206 development schemes under various sectors for laying the broader missing foundation of development in the merged district. In the first year 2019-20, a total of 127 schemes were implemented at a cost of Rs.24 billion under different sectors such as health, roads, irrigation, and agriculture etc. which are 100% completed. In financial year 2020-21 a total of 261 schemes under different sector such as health, education, water, irrigation, and agriculture are undertaken at a cost of Rs.49 billion which are in different stages of completion. In 2021-22 a total of 308 schemes including 206 ongoing and 106 new schemes are being implemented at a cost of Rs.36 billion in sector like roads, irrigation, housing, industries, IT, and transport.\n'
          'The Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has assigned this task to Sustainable Development Unit headed by Director General, in Planning and Development, exhibiting its commitment of ownership and interest for timely completion of these schemes in judicious manner. The prime objective of this whole exercise of provincial and federal government allocating such huge development portfolio for the first time in development history of Pakistan is to ensure that benefits of merger are truly demonstrated and seen by the residents of Merged Areas through improvement in service delivery and uplift in socioeconomic indicators.  In addition to this, a special program titled as Qabail Led Development Program has been introduced in AIP to take care of small community infrastructure schemes in close collaboration with local people of the Merged Areas. \n'
          'Here, the role of community groups in the Merged Areas would be vital for playing a positive role in raising their voices through their elected representatives and other forums made available by government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Community role will become more visible and prominent once the local government elections are held in the Merged Areas. This would open new avenues of development both political and economic empowerment with a focus on youth, women, and other minorities. Communities should engage with government under Qabail Led Development Program for sustainable and need based development through active participation in the whole process starting with identification, execution, monitoring and operation and maintenance of these schemes.\n',
