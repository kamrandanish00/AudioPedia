        "Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).This is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. A family of viruses that can cause infectious disease i.e. respiratory illness in humans is called “Corona,” – because of the crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus."
        "•	Examples are --- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS and  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome  MERS and the common cold"
        "•	A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus"
        "Coronavirus is a zoonotic in nature which transmits between animal and people. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, and cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard Operating Procedure for control of Covid -19 is social distancing, regular hand washing, wearing of mask and avoiding of crowded places and people showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.",

        'The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared for the first time in Wuhan City of Hubei province in China in December 2019 which spread all around China and even to other countries in the world. Since the Covid -19 cases kept on mounting even in a higher ratio than SARC cases in 2003 forced WHO to declare it a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020.The situation took an ugly turn in March 2020 when Covid -19 was declared a pandemic with outbreak in different countries and continents of the world all over.  These facts were enough to illustrate the severity and complexity of the outbreak.'
        'Given the fact that no effective medicine is available for viral infectious diseases, except the lately developed vaccine against Covid 19, it becomes all the more important to adopt preventive measure for timely control of infection, early detection, stopping of Covid 19. Doctors and paramedics are the main fighting force to control the Covid 19; however public participation is inevitable for effective control of pandemic through proper dissemination of relevant information to the public.'
        'To control Covid -19 further spread, this user-friendly manual on Audiopedia, for public at large has been developed to be well aware of the basic knowledge of Covid 19, its symptoms, preventive measures and essential treatment. Which is intended to serve as systematic guide for public? It will play an essential role in popularizing relevant knowledge, raising awareness of disease prevention and control, and preventing social panic. ',
