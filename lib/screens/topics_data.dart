    description:
        'The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared for the first time in Wuhan City of Hubei province in China in December 2019 which spread all around China and even to other countries in the world. Since the COVID-19 cases kept on mounting even in a higher ratio than SARC cases in 2003 forced WHO to declare it a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020.The situation took an ugly turn in March 2020 when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic with outbreak in different countries and continents of the world all over.  These facts were enough to illustrate the severity and complexity of the outbreak.\n\n'
        'Given the fact that no effective medicine is available for viral infectious diseases, except the lately developed vaccine against COVID-19, it becomes all the more important to adopt preventive measure for timely control of infection, early detection, stopping of COVID-19. Doctors and paramedics are the main fighting force to control the COVID-19; however public participation is inevitable for effective control of pandemic through proper dissemination of relevant information to the public.\n\n'
        'To control COVID-19 further spread, this user-friendly manual on Audiopedia, for public at large has been developed to be well aware of the basic knowledge of COVID-19, its symptoms, preventive measures and essential treatment. Which is intended to serve as systematic guide for public? It will play an essential role in popularizing relevant knowledge, raising awareness of disease prevention and control, and preventing social panic.\n\n',
